## **Installation**
1. In order to run the application, download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local device.  ***Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.***
2. After installing Node, clone the [Professional README Generator Repo](https://github.com/ChristopherLawn/readme-generator) to a project folder on your local device.
3. Open Bash and navigate to the root directory of the project folder.
4. Install all required dependencies for the project by entering the code:
    `npm install`.

## **Usage**
1. Once the dependencies are installed, run the app from the command line in Bash by entering the code:
    `node index.js`.  This will initiate a series of prompts.
2. Answer all prompts corresponding to each section of the README.  ***NOTE: All input is case-sensitive, so it is recommended that you double-check all of your work before submitting each answer.***
3. When all prompts have been answered, find your newly created README file in the 'dist' folder located inside the main project folder!
4. When creating multiple README files for different projects, make sure to copy and save each file to a separate destination before running the app again.  Each time the app is run, the README file in the 'dist' folder will be replaced with the newest version.
