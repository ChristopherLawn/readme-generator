## **Installation**
2. In order to run the application, download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local device.  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
1. After installing Node, clone the [Professional README Generator Repo](https://github.com/ChristopherLawn/readme-generator) to a project folder on your local device.
4. Open Bash and navigate to the root directory of the project folder.
5. Install the Node Package Manager(npm) by entering the code:
    `npm install`.  ***NOTE: npm is the package manager for Node.js created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.***

## **Usage**
4. Once npm is installed, run the app from the command line by entering the code:
    `node index.js`.  This will initiate a series of prompts.
6. Answer all prompts for each section of the README.  ***NOTE: All input is case-sensitive, so it is recommended that you double-check your work before submitting each answer.***
7. When all prompts have been answered, find your newly created README file in the 'dist' folder inside the main project folder!
8. When creating multiple README files for different projects, make sure to copy and save each file to a separate destination before running the app again.  Each time the app is run, the README file in the 'dist' folder will be replaced with the newest version.
